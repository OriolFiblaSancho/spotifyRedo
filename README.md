This is a frontend clone of the spotify web, you can't listen to any music in here, just check the animations and say wooo it does look kindaaa like the real spotify main page. I ended up using copilot because this was getting complicated and I wanted to do more project but almost all the page is done just using my incredible skills of googling.

Hope you like it <3
